# A Comparision Between Locally Weighted Regression and Random Forest
This project will compare the performance of random forest regressor and locally weighted regression on smaples with one variable. The dataset I choose for the purpose of this project is Boston Housing Prices. Mean Square Error is used to evaluate the accuracy of the two models. I will do a K fold cross validation on the result of the predictions made by each model. 

## Random Forest
